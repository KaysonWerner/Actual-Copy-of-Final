## Examples

Here's an example prompt and response from the OpenAI Playground:

```text
Prompt: "Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms."
Response: "The theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, explains how space and time are linked in a four-dimensional fabric called spacetime. The theory states that the presence of mass and energy causes spacetime to curve, and objects moving through this curved space experience gravity."
